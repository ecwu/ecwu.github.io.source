I started to learn NLP-related stuff in mid-2018. And gradually start to some serious research. My focus mainly on Natural Language Generation (NLG).

## Beginning: SemEval2019

By the end of 2018, members of the AI learning group {{% sidenote "ai-learning-group" %}}Lead by Prof. Weifeng Su{{% /sidenote %}} decide to take part in the SemEval 2019. To study and learning more about NLP. 

Our group chose task 6: Identifying and Categorizing Offensive Language in Social Media (OffensEval). Which the input text is users' tweets and we need to classify it.

There are three subtasks. Task A needs to identify the offensive language. Task B needs to categorization the offensive type. And Task C needs to identify the offensive target.

We used the BERT model, which is state-of-the-art at that time for text classification. But our experiment limit to changing the preprocessing methods and some simple ensemble (not even proper) methods. But is still fun to learn such an advanced model and some NLP methods.

## Final Year Project: LenAtten

We proposed an novel attention-based module for RNN-based Encoder-Decoder Model for Fixed Length Summerization Task. The proposed method achieved good results on CNN/Daily Mail and English Gigaword Dataset.

## MSc Independent Project: XXX

This is work is still under anonymity period, more details will publish once suitable.
