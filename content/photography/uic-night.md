These photos were taken during the period (June 2020) which is the last chance to dwell in my college (BNU-HKBU UIC). Because of the global pandemic of COVID-19, the school is only allowing year four students to come back. And when I took these pictures people mostly depart and the campus is nearly empty.

However, this easily makes the picture have the emotion of calm and isolation that I tend to express.

Specs:
- Film: Kodak Portra 400
- Camera & Lens: Mamiya RB67 Pro S, 127mm f3.8 lens.
