Hang out with friends in Shenzhen. In the evening, we saw a nice sunset in [OH BAY](http://en.sasac.gov.cn/2020/10/09/c_5587.htm).

On the way back home, I saw more breathtaking scenery. And I captured it with my camera.

The images are shot using a slow shutter speed, and the shape of the objects is dragged by the movement of the cabin. I arrange the image in a linear (both in time and space) manner. Along with intertwined artificial lights, urban buildings, and twilight sky in the frame. I try to create an emotional transition from active to calm with these four images. 

Like dragging a person from a non-stop city center to a warm and peaceful home.

Just like the time I was taking the photos. Been "dragged" back home by the metro.
