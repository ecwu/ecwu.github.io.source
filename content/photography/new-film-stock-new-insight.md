The new year trip to Shenzhen is another photography trip. Apart from meeting my friend in a tight schedule, testing my first roll of Cinestill 800T is the side mission. I also brought a roll of expired Kodak Portra 400 and ILFORD HP5 Plus with me. Since they sit in my fridge for a long time.


## Cinestill 800T

The film is not something brand new, I heard about its big name from lots of film photograph KOL at least 3 years ago. This film is basically Kodak's Vision 3 5219 (500T) movie film. One key feature for the movie film is it come with a Remjet (Anti-halation backing) layer, which is a layer of black carbon (calls remjet) on film to prevent light halation. Originally, the film with remjet layer require one extra step in the develop process to remove it. What Cinestill do is bought the film from kodak and pre-move the layer so that it can be developed in normal C-41 process (a general process for color film). But as an result, the film will have a unique halation effect, which is the signature of this film.

Another new thing for me is the film is a **T**ungsten film, this means it is designed for tungsten light (~3200K warm light). The film will have a blue cast under daylight, Plus it is a 800 ISO high-speed film, which create a great combination for night scene. A similar film I can think of is the discontinued Fujifilm PRO400H, though it is not rated tungsten, but it is a 400 ISO film with a blue and cold cast under daylight. And result in a quite similar color tone.

## Expired Kodak Portra 400

I always says, the best investment I have made is buying film. In 2019, a roll of Kodak Portra 400 cost me 48 RMB (6.55 USD according to 2025 CNY-USD exchange rate). Now, the price is 122 RMB (16.66 USD) with a turnover rate of 250%. The film is expired in mid 2021. 

Usually, it won't be a big problem if you store the film properly. Which means, keep it in a fridge. But from my memory, I done the transfer to my fridge later 2022. So, I am not sure how the film will turn out.
