This work is the final project of the Photography FE (Free Elective) Course. It shows how I am "living" in classroom 307 of the laboratory building.

In June 2019, about to be my senior year, I started my graduation project. Academic research requires long-term devotion, so classroom 307, as our stronghold, became where I spent the longest time in my last year of college (since COVID-19 destroyed the second semester). I spent more than 500 hours staying in that place. To study, do experiments, rest, and entertain.

I thought of four scenes to show my feeling. All of the photos are shot staged in an exaggerated style (staged photography). I try to add as many details as possible to incorporate a subtle mood into the picture.
