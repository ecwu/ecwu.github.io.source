## [Techno Tim](https://www.youtube.com/c/TechnoTimLive/featured)

A software engineer shares knowledge and live demos about server stuff (especially self-hosting servers and home lab). I have learned a lot about Docker, Kubernetes, and reverse proxy after seeing his video.

## [Posy](https://www.youtube.com/c/PosyMusic)

The YouTube algorithm pushed this author to my timeline with a video about [Segmented Displays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTB5XhjbgZA&t=2s). His content is well organized with enough content and sound visualizationsâ€”an excellent source for learning new stuff (or old stuff in a new way).

## [Just A Printer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSuSPbvmwLZv9CMdeSsWkFA)

A man working for a publishing company, all content about how to make publish products and maintenance printer. [This is a video tour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTbQpPOC4U0) about his print shop.

> Initial Recommendations

## [Wintergatan](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcXhhVwCT6_WqjkEniejRJQ)

A band from Sweden. The creator of [Marble Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvUU8joBb1Q) and Marble Machine X ([Building Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld7zTApixXE&list=PLLLYkE3G1HED6rW-bkliHbMroHYFf4ukv)). They make great music and engineering content.

## [Rob Scallon](https://www.youtube.com/c/robscallon)

American musician, list some videos I really enjoy:

- [Getting Delay, without using any effects...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNzBFgwkU0A)
- [Making an Album in a Day (w/ Andrew Huang)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QT0Bvf2FIQ)

## [LockPickingLawyer](https://www.youtube.com/c/lockpickinglawyer)

A Channel about security devices (locks mostly), and his lockpicking technique is amazing!

## [Stuff Made Here](https://www.youtube.com/c/StuffMadeHere)

Shane Wighton, engineer. Making videos about his random idea (quite interesting). Mind-blowing crafting and coding ability.

[Auto-aiming bow vs. FLYING targets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MkrNVic7pw)

## [Adam Neely](https://www.youtube.com/c/AdamNeely)

NYC-based bass player and composer, Interesting music theory.
