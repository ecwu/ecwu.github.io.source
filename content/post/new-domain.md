Starting from Aug 11, 2021. I am starting a new domain name for my website.

> [ecwu.xyz](https://ecwu.xyz)

Personally, the old domain name (ecwuuuuu.com) is good but is it a little bit longer in length and maybe difficult for people to memorize and use. So, I register this domain name to create some convenience for others (but mostly for myself :)).

Currently, I am don't have a concrete plan for how to utilize these two domains. But I will probably migrate all my info page and service to the new domain. The domain email and blog will still keep in the old one. I will keep thinking about this, and sync the progress on this page in the future.

Update log:
- 2021.09.01: A Landing page is setup for the site, CI with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
- 2021.08.11: Accessing the [root](https://ecwu.xyz) and [www](https://www.ecwu.xyz) subdomain of the new domain will 302 redirect to [ecwuuuuu.com](https://ecwuuuuu.com) via a URL forwarding rule using Cloudflare.

More info:
- This domain is register at Gandi.com
- I launch a new subdomain [foto.ecwuuuuu.com](https://foto.ecwuuuuu.com) ~~[chaos.ecwuuuuu.com](https://chaos.ecwuuuuu.com)~~ with [Ghost](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost) as backend. I tend to use it as a more friendly and more good-looking site for my photo project. But I don't guarantee the service will run without termination in the future.
