This topic first come to my mind when I was in college as a freshman. I don't quite remember what application am I going to embed this. But the goal is clear: for color in hex or RGB format, find a name to accurately describe it.

Revisiting this topic because I saw a forum post, about a color-blind prople seeking for solution to identifying the color. I immediately recall the experience I had almost five years ago.

My experience immediately recalls. But after I did some prototype coding, I find the result is not as good as I expected. Which drives me to learn more about the topic.

And result in this article.
