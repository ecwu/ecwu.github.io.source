In my last photography related post: [Try the Film For the First Time]({{< ref "/post/try-the-film-for-the-first-time" >}}). I indeed have some fun with film. This makes me want to have my own camera to experience this medium that has existed for nearly 200 years. {{% sidenote "film-exist-time" %}}Although the film we still use today was invented by Kodak in 1888, the earliest photosensitive material that uses in photography can date back to 1835.{{% /sidenote %}}{{< figure

 At first place, I was focusing on some electronic one like Canon EOS 55 or Canon EOS 5. But later, I notice there is a kind of camera: 120 format.
