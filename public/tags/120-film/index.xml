      <description>In my last photography-related post: Try the Film For the First Time. I have lots of fun with negatives. This makes me want to have my own camera to experience this medium that has existed for nearly 200 years.  The film we are still using today was invented by Kodak in 1888, but photosensitive material that uses in photography can date back to 1835. ⊕ View from the Window at Le Gras  Jonnychiwa [CC BY-SA 4.</description>
